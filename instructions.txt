-- TO PLAY THE GAME --
The game consists of two rooms divided by a door. There are two types of particles: hot (red) and cold (blue).
A player is scored based on how great of a temperature differential they can create between the two rooms.

At the top of the screen, there are two buttons:
    "Add Particles" adds 1 hot and 1 cold particle to each side of the door.
    "Reset" resets the game, the score and each room to only 2 particles. It also displays the player's score.

-- FUTURE UPDATES --
1. Update the temperature models to use more accurate physics.
2. Update the view to change the background color for each room depending on the temperature,
    like a swatch.
3. Track scores and create a High Score system.
4. Create an opportunity to share score with someone.
5. Create a control tab to directly type the number of balls to populate the rooms with,
    rather than clicking each time.
